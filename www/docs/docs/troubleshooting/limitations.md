# Limitations

## Limitations

- Doesn't support class components
- `@cxnpl/react-ts-form` doesn't currently support dependent field props (but will in the future), so you won't be able to modify the behavior of input components based on form values (for example if you needed to hide a form field based on the value of another form field)
